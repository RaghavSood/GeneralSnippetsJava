		 * Why this isPrime method is better than the one you're probably using:
		 * 
		 * It doesn't check all integers between 1 and n, because that's a
		 * stupid way to do things. Instead, it checks against only 2 and add
		 * integers up to the square root of n, because that's the smart way to
		 * do things.
		 * 
		 * Reasons for the above:
		 * 
		 * 1) We learned numbers are prime if the only divisors they have are 1
		 * and itself. Trivially, we can check every integer from 1 to itself
		 * (exclusive) and test whether it divides evenly. This might tempt us
		 * to check every number between 1 and n.
		 * 
		 * 2) This doesn’t seem bad at first, but we can make it faster – much
		 * faster. Consider that if 2 divides some integer n, then (n/2) divides
		 * n as well. This tells us we don’t have to try out all integers from 2
		 * to n. Due to this, we only check against the number 2. We don't need
		 * to check against the multiples of 2, and have immediately cut down
		 * the numbers we must check against to half./n
		 * 
		 * 3) Finally, we know that you really only have to go up to the square
		 * root of n, because if you list out all of the factors of a number,
		 * the square root will always be in the middle (if it happens to not be
		 * an integer, we’re still okay, we just might over-approximate, but our
		 * code will still work).
